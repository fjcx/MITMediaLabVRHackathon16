At the MIT Media Lab Reality, Virtually, Hackathon I wrote the software for "Blue Note" an interactive 360 video Jazz experience for Oculus Rift developed using Unity3D. For the project we captured 360 video and binaural audio and created an interactive VR experience focusing on spatial audio. https://devpost.com/software/directed-story-telling
